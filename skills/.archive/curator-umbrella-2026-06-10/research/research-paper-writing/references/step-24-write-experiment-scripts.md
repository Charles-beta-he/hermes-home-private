### Step 2.4: Write Experiment Scripts

Follow these patterns from successful research pipelines:

**Incremental saving** — save results after each step for crash recovery:
```python
# Save after each problem/task
result_path = f"results/{task}/{strategy}/result.json"
if os.path.exists(result_path):
    continue  # Skip already-completed work
# ... run experiment ...
with open(result_path, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(result, f, indent=2)
```

**Artifact preservation** — save all intermediate outputs:
```
results/<experiment>/
  <task>/
    <strategy>/
      final_output.md          # Final result
      history.json             # Full trajectory
      pass_01/                 # Per-iteration artifacts
        version_a.md
        version_b.md
        critic.md
```

**Separation of concerns** — keep generation, evaluation, and visualization separate:
```
run_experiment.py              # Core experiment runner
run_baselines.py               # Baseline comparison
run_comparison_judge.py        # Blind evaluation
analyze_results.py             # Statistical analysis
make_charts.py                 # Visualization
```
