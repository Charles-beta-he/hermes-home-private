### Step 3.5: Maintain an Experiment Journal

Git commits track what happened, but not the **exploration tree** — the decisions about what to try next based on what you learned. Maintain a structured experiment journal that captures this tree:

```json
// experiment_journal.jsonl — append one entry per experiment attempt
{
  "id": "exp_003",
  "parent": "exp_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-10T14:30:00Z",
  "hypothesis": "Adding scope constraints will fix convergence failure from exp_001",
  "plan": "Re-run autoreason with max_tokens=2000 and fixed structure template",
  "config": {"model": "haiku", "strategy": "autoreason", "max_tokens": 2000},
  "status": "completed",
  "result_path": "results/exp_003/",
  "key_metrics": {"win_rate": 0.85, "convergence_rounds": 3},
  "analysis": "Scope constraints fixed convergence. Win rate jumped from 0.42 to 0.85.",
  "next_steps": ["Try same constraints on Sonnet", "Test without structure template"],
  "figures": ["figures/exp003_convergence.pdf"]
}
```

**Why a journal, not just git?** Git tracks file changes. The journal tracks the reasoning: why you tried X, what you learned, and what that implies for the next experiment. When writing the paper, this tree is invaluable for the Methods section ("we observed X, which motivated Y") and for honest failure reporting.

**Selecting the best path**: When the journal shows a branching tree (exp_001 → exp_002a, exp_002b, exp_003), identify the path that best supports the paper's claims. Document dead-end branches in the appendix as ablations or negative results.

**Snapshot code per experiment**: Copy the experiment script after each run:
```bash
cp experiment.py results/exp_003/experiment_snapshot.py
```
This enables exact reproduction even after subsequent code changes.
