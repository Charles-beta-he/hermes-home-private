# Workflow

## Workflow

1. **Understand the brief**
   - What is being designed?
   - Who is it for?
   - What artifact should exist at the end?
   - What constraints are locked?

2. **Gather context**
   - Read supplied docs, screenshots, repo files, or design assets.
   - Identify the visual vocabulary before writing code.

3. **Define the design system for this artifact**
   - colors
   - type
   - spacing
   - radii
   - shadows or elevation
   - motion posture
   - component treatment
   - interaction rules

4. **Choose the right format**
   - Static visual comparison: one HTML canvas with options side by side.
   - Interaction/flow: clickable prototype.
   - Presentation: fixed-size HTML deck with slide navigation.
   - Component exploration: component lab with variants.
   - Motion: timeline or state-based animation.

5. **Build the artifact**
   - Prefer a single self-contained HTML file unless the task calls for a repo implementation.
   - Preserve prior versions for major revisions.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

6. **Verify**
   - Confirm files exist.
   - Run any available syntax/static checks.
   - If browser tools are available, open the file and check console errors.
   - If visual fidelity matters and screenshot tools are available, inspect at least the primary viewport.

7. **Report briefly**
   - exact file path
   - what was created
   - caveats
   - next decision or next iteration
