# p5.js Production Pipeline

## Overview

Production pipeline for interactive and generative visual art using p5.js.

## When to Use

- Users request: p5.js sketches, creative coding, generative art, interactive visualizations, canvas animations, browser-based visual art, data viz, shader effects, or any p5.js project


- Don't use for: tasks outside this skill's trigger class, requests with a more specific neighboring skill, or situations where required evidence/tooling is unavailable.
## Creative Standard

This is visual art rendered in the browser. The canvas is the medium; the algorithm is the brush.

**Before writing a single line of code**, articulate the creative concept. What does this piece communicate? What makes the viewer stop scrolling? What separates this from a code tutorial example? The user's prompt is a starting point — interpret it with creative ambition.

**First-render excellence is non-negotiable.** The output must be visually striking on first load. If it looks like a p5.js tutorial exercise, a default configuration, or "AI-generated creative coding," it is wrong. Rethink before shipping.

**Go beyond the reference vocabulary.** The noise functions, particle systems, color palettes, and shader effects in the references are a starting vocabulary. For every project, combine, layer, and invent. The catalog is a palette of paints — you write the painting.

**Be proactively creative.** If the user asks for "a particle system," deliver a particle system with emergent flocking behavior, trailing ghost echoes, palette-shifted depth fog, and a background noise field that breathes. Include at least one visual detail the user didn't ask for but will appreciate.

**Dense, layered, considered.** Every frame should reward viewing. Never flat white backgrounds. Always compositional hierarchy. Always intentional color. Always micro-detail that only appears on close inspection.

**Cohesive aesthetic over feature count.** All elements must serve a unified visual language — shared color temperature, consistent stroke weight vocabulary, harmonious motion speeds. A sketch with ten unrelated effects is worse than one with three that belong together.

## Modes

| Mode | Input | Output | Reference |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Generative art** | Seed / parameters | Procedural visual composition (still or animated) | `references/visual-effects.md` |
| **Data visualization** | Dataset / API | Interactive charts, graphs, custom data displays | `references/interaction.md` |
| **Interactive experience** | None (user drives) | Mouse/keyboard/touch-driven sketch | `references/interaction.md` |
| **Animation / motion graphics** | Timeline / storyboard | Timed sequences, kinetic typography, transitions | `references/animation.md` |
| **3D scene** | Concept description | WebGL geometry, lighting, camera, materials | `references/webgl-and-3d.md` |
| **Image processing** | Image file(s) | Pixel manipulation, filters, mosaic, pointillism | `references/visual-effects.md` § Pixel Manipulation |
| **Audio-reactive** | Audio file / mic | Sound-driven generative visuals | `references/interaction.md` § Audio Input |

## Stack

Single self-contained HTML file per project. No build step required.

| Layer | Tool | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Core | p5.js 1.11.3 (CDN) | Canvas rendering, math, transforms, event handling |
| 3D | p5.js WebGL mode | 3D geometry, camera, lighting, GLSL shaders |
| Audio | p5.sound.js (CDN) | FFT analysis, amplitude, mic input, oscillators |
| Export | Built-in `saveCanvas()` / `saveGif()` / `saveFrames()` | PNG, GIF, frame sequence output |
| Capture | CCapture.js (optional) | Deterministic framerate video capture (WebM, GIF) |
| Headless | Puppeteer + Node.js (optional) | Automated high-res rendering, MP4 via ffmpeg |
| SVG | p5.js-svg 1.6.0 (optional) | Vector output for print — requires p5.js 1.x |
| Natural media | p5.brush (optional) | Watercolor, charcoal, pen — requires p5.js 2.x + WEBGL |
| Texture | p5.grain (optional) | Film grain, texture overlays |
| Fonts | Google Fonts / `loadFont()` | Custom typography via OTF/TTF/WOFF2 |

### Version Note

**p5.js 1.x** (1.11.3) is the default — stable, well-documented, broadest library compatibility. Use this unless a project requires 2.x features.

**p5.js 2.x** (2.2+) adds: `async setup()` replacing `preload()`, OKLCH/OKLAB color modes, `splineVertex()`, shader `.modify()` API, variable fonts, `textToContours()`, pointer events. Required for p5.brush. See `references/core-api.md` § p5.js 2.0.

## Pipeline

Every project follows the same 6-stage path:

```
CONCEPT → DESIGN → CODE → PREVIEW → EXPORT → VERIFY
```

1. **CONCEPT** — Articulate the creative vision: mood, color world, motion vocabulary, what makes this unique
2. **DESIGN** — Choose mode, canvas size, interaction model, color system, export format. Map concept to technical decisions
3. **CODE** — Write single HTML file with inline p5.js. Structure: globals → `preload()` → `setup()` → `draw()` → helpers → classes → event handlers
4. **PREVIEW** — Open in browser, verify visual quality. Test at target resolution. Check performance
5. **EXPORT** — Capture output: `saveCanvas()` for PNG, `saveGif()` for GIF, `saveFrames()` + ffmpeg for MP4, Puppeteer for headless batch
6. **VERIFY** — Does the output match the concept? Is it visually striking at the intended display size? Would you frame it?

### Per-Project Variation Rules

Never use default configurations. For every project:
- **Custom color palette** — never raw `fill(255, 0, 0)`. Always a designed palette with 3-7 colors
- **Custom stroke weight vocabulary** — thin accents (0.5), medium structure (1-2), bold emphasis (3-5)
- **Background treatment** — never plain `background(0)` or `background(255)`. Always textured, gradient, or layered
- **Motion variety** — different speeds for different elements. Primary at 1x, secondary at 0.3x, ambient at 0.1x
- **At least one invented element** — a custom particle behavior, a novel noise application, a unique interaction response

### Project-Specific Invention

For every project, invent at least one of:
- A custom color palette matching the mood (not a preset)
- A novel noise field combination (e.g., curl noise + domain warp + feedback)
- A unique particle behavior (custom forces, custom trails, custom spawning)
- An interaction mechanic the user didn't request but that elevates the piece
- A compositional technique that creates visual hierarchy

### Parameter Design Philosophy

Parameters should emerge from the algorithm, not from a generic menu. Ask: "What properties of *this* system should be tunable?"

**Good parameters** expose the algorithm's character:
- **Quantities** — how many particles, branches, cells (controls density)
- **Scales** — noise frequency, element size, spacing (controls texture)
- **Rates** — speed, growth rate, decay (controls energy)
- **Thresholds** — when does behavior change? (controls drama)
- **Ratios** — proportions, balance between forces (controls harmony)

**Bad parameters** are generic controls unrelated to the algorithm:
- "color1", "color2", "size" — meaningless without context
- Toggle switches for unrelated effects
- Parameters that only change cosmetics, not behavior

Every parameter should change how the algorithm *thinks*, not just how it *looks*. A "turbulence" parameter that changes noise octaves is good. A "particle size" slider that only changes `ellipse()` radius is shallow.

## Creative Divergence (use only when user requests experimental/creative/unique output)

If the user asks for creative, experimental, surprising, or unconventional output, select the strategy that best fits and reason through its steps BEFORE generating code.

- **Conceptual Blending** — when the user names two things to combine or wants hybrid aesthetics
- **SCAMPER** — when the user wants a twist on a known generative art pattern
- **Distance Association** — when the user gives a single concept and wants exploration ("make something about time")

### Conceptual Blending
1. Name two distinct visual systems (e.g., particle physics + handwriting)
2. Map correspondences (particles = ink drops, forces = pen pressure, fields = letterforms)
3. Blend selectively — keep mappings that produce interesting emergent visuals
4. Code the blend as a unified system, not two systems side-by-side

### SCAMPER Transformation
Take a known generative pattern (flow field, particle system, L-system, cellular automata) and systematically transform it:
- **Substitute**: replace circles with text characters, lines with gradients
- **Combine**: merge two patterns (flow field + voronoi)
- **Adapt**: apply a 2D pattern to a 3D projection
- **Modify**: exaggerate scale, warp the coordinate space
- **Purpose**: use a physics sim for typography, a sorting algorithm for color
- **Eliminate**: remove the grid, remove color, remove symmetry
- **Reverse**: run the simulation backward, invert the parameter space

### Distance Association
1. Anchor on the user's concept (e.g., "loneliness")
2. Generate associations at three distances:
   - Close (obvious): empty room, single figure, silence
   - Medium (interesting): one fish in a school swimming the wrong way, a phone with no notifications, the gap between subway cars
   - Far (abstract): prime numbers, asymptotic curves, the color of 3am
3. Develop the medium-distance associations — they're specific enough to visualize but unexpected enough to be interesting

## Common Pitfalls

1. Loading this skill outside its trigger class and skipping a simpler, more direct path.
2. Ignoring prerequisites such as platform, credentials, installed commands, or linked reference files.
3. Treating the skill as a static memo instead of verifying the exact commands, artifacts, or outputs in the current environment.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] The task actually matches this skill's trigger class and the current route is still appropriate.
- [ ] All prerequisites, linked references, templates, scripts, and required tools have been checked before execution.
- [ ] Claimed outputs, commands, files, or external side-effects were read back or otherwise verified before completion.
